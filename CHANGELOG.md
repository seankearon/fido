# Changelog

All notable changes to Fido are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Close delay** after a successful launch. When Fido is set to close after opening
  (see **Close after opening**), it now counts down before quitting instead of vanishing
  instantly. The flight log shows a single line that ticks down in place (`Closing in 10…` → `9…`
  → `8…`) and a **Keep open** bar appears at the bottom of the window with the live countdown —
  click it to call off the close. Starting another open also cancels it. The delay is configurable in Settings
  (default **10 seconds**; **0** closes immediately), and selecting **Never** turns auto-close
  off entirely.

### Fixed

- Pressing **Enter** in the Branch (or Solution) box now opens in a single press.
  Previously the first Enter only dismissed the MRU suggestion drop-down, so you
  had to press Enter again to launch. The keystroke now closes the drop-down and
  acts on the entered branch in one go.
